## Pre-Development AI Instructions

### Core Directive for AI Assistant
```
MANDATORY: Before suggesting any code or architecture:
1. Ask: "What evidence proves this approach is profitable?"
2. Require: Backtesting results with >10% annual returns
3. Demand: Working execution of previous phase before new features
4. Verify: All claims with actual data, not theoretical projections
5. Check: Configuration-driven design maintained
6. Ensure: Backward compatibility preserved
```

## Phase-Gate Validation Checklist

### Before ANY Development Session
- [x] **Previous phase 100% complete?** Phase 4.5 complete (CV implementation)
- [ ] **Profitable strategy proven?** Awaiting Phase 5 (Portfolio Optimization)
- [ ] **Working execution system?** Data pipeline operational, execution pending
- [x] **Budget constraints respected?** Free tier data sources only

### Before Adding New Features
- [ ] **Business case proven?** How does this improve returns by >1%?
- [ ] **Complexity justified?** Can current system handle added complexity?
- [ ] **Dependencies validated?** All required data sources tested and working
- [ ] **Rollback plan ready?** How to revert if new feature fails

## Code Development Guards

### AI Instruction Template
```
You are developing a trading system with strict constraints:

REQUIREMENTS:
- Maximum 500 lines of code per phase
- Must work with free data sources only
- Prove profitability before adding complexity
- No ML models until Phase 7+ and $25K+ capital

FORBIDDEN RESPONSES:
- "This would be better with [complex framework]"
- "Consider using [ML model] for better performance"
- "You should architect this as microservices"
- Any suggestion requiring >$50/month operational cost

REQUIRED FOR EVERY CODE SUGGESTION:
- Exact line count estimate
- Data source validation method
- Performance test specification
- Failure mode handling
```

### Code Review Checklist (Every Session)
- [ ] **Line count under phase limit?** Count actual lines, not estimates
- [ ] **Dependencies verified working?** Test imports and data access
- [ ] **Error handling included?** Network failures, missing data, calculation errors
- [ ] **Performance metrics tracked?** Execution time, memory usage, accuracy
- [ ] **Documentation minimal but complete?** What it does, why it exists, how to test

## Data Science Validation Protocol

### Before ANY ML Model Discussion
- [ ] **Baseline strategy profitable?** Simple moving average beating buy-and-hold
- [ ] **Data quality proven?** >95% data availability, <1% outliers
- [ ] **Feature engineering justified?** Clear hypothesis about why feature helps
- [ ] **Computational resources adequate?** Memory and GPU requirements calculated

### ML Model Introduction Gates

#### SARIMAX Introduction (Phase 7 Only)
**Prerequisites checklist:**
- [ ] 6+ months profitable paper trading documented
- [ ] Simple strategy Sharpe ratio >1.0 proven
- [ ] Clear economic hypothesis for features
- [ ] GPU memory requirements <8GB calculated

#### SAMOSSA Introduction (Phase 10 Only)
**Prerequisites checklist:**
- [ ] SARIMAX models beating baseline by >1% annually
- [ ] Mathematical understanding of SSA demonstrated
- [ ] GPU implementation tested on synthetic data
- [ ] Model interpretation framework ready

#### DQN Introduction (Phase 12+ Only)
**Prerequisites checklist:**
- [ ] $100,000+ live capital committed
- [ ] Other ML models adding proven value
- [ ] Reinforcement learning theory understood
- [ ] Multi-month training timeline accepted

## Architecture Discipline Checklist

### Before Any "Refactoring" or "Improvement"
- [ ] **Current system profitable?** Prove with 30+ days live results
- [ ] **Specific problem identified?** Performance bottleneck or profit limitation
- [ ] **Solution impact quantified?** Expected improvement in returns/speed
- [ ] **Implementation time bounded?** Maximum 1 week for any change

### Anti-Pattern Detection
**Red flag responses from AI:**
- [ ] Suggests complete rewrite of working code
- [ ] Proposes framework changes without profit justification
- [ ] Recommends "best practices" that add complexity
- [ ] Mentions "scalability" before achieving profitability
- [ ] Discusses "maintainability" for <1000 line codebase

## Performance Monitoring Framework

### Daily Development Metrics
```bash
# Run these commands every development session
echo "=== Reality Check ==="
echo "Lines of code: $(find . -name '*.py' | xargs wc -l | tail -1)"
echo "Git commits today: $(git log --since='1 day ago' --oneline | wc -l)"
echo "Working strategies: $(python test_strategies.py --count-profitable)"
echo "Monthly costs: $$(python calculate_costs.py)"
```

### Weekly Validation Protocol
- [ ] **Strategy performance test** - Run full backtest, verify >10% annual returns
- [ ] **System integration test** - Execute end-to-end trade simulation
- [ ] **Cost accounting** - Verify monthly expenses under budget
- [ ] **Complexity audit** - Count lines of code, assess if each is necessary

## AI Session Management

### Start-of-Session Protocol
```
Before discussing any development:
1. Show current profitability metrics
2. Confirm current phase completion status
3. State specific problem being solved
4. Set session time limit (maximum 2 hours)
```

### End-of-Session Validation
- [ ] **Code works?** All suggested code tested and functional
- [ ] **Performance measured?** Runtime, accuracy, resource usage documented
- [ ] **Next steps clear?** Specific tasks for next session defined
- [ ] **No scope creep?** Did not add features beyond current phase

## Emergency Stop Conditions

### Immediate Development Halt Required When:
- [ ] **Monthly costs exceed budget** by any amount
- [ ] **Strategy loses money** for >7 consecutive days
- [ ] **System cannot execute trades** for >24 hours
- [ ] **Code complexity** exceeds phase limits by >20%
- [ ] **AI suggests major architecture changes** without profit justification

### Recovery Protocol:
1. Stop all development immediately
2. Revert to last working version
3. Re-run profitability validation
4. Identify specific failure cause
5. Resume only after root cause addressed

## Documentation Requirements

### Mandatory Files (Updated Weekly)
- [ ] **PERFORMANCE.md** - Current strategy returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns
- [ ] **COSTS.md** - Monthly expense breakdown with receipts
- [ ] **ROADMAP.md** - Phase completion status, next priorities
- [ ] **FAILURES.md** - What didn't work and why, lessons learned

### Decision Log Template
```
Date: 2024-XX-XX
Decision: [What was decided]
Reason: [Why this approach chosen]
Evidence: [Data supporting decision]
Success Criteria: [How to measure if this worked]
Review Date: [When to reassess]
```

## Human Oversight Checkpoints

### Weekly Self-Assessment Questions
1. **Am I making money?** Show actual profitable trades, not backtests
2. **Am I staying focused?** Working on current phase, not future features
3. **Am I being realistic?** Costs under budget, timeline reasonable
4. **Am I avoiding complexity?** System simple enough to understand completely

### Monthly Reality Check
- [ ] **Third-party validation** - Show results to someone not involved in project
- [ ] **Competitor analysis** - How do results compare to index funds?
- [ ] **Stress test** - What happens if strategy fails for 30 days?
- [ ] **Exit planning** - At what point would you stop this project?

This checklist is designed to prevent the architectural over-engineering and analysis paralysis that has characterized your previous development cycles. The key is rigorous adherence to the phase-gate approach and absolute rejection of complexity until profitability is proven.


# Enhanced DevOps Guardrails: Testing, Version Control, and Deployment

## Testing Framework (Reality-Based)

### Unit Testing Requirements by Phase

#### Phase 1-3: Core Testing Only
**Maximum 200 lines of test code** - Don't spend more time testing than developing

```python
# test_core_functions.py - Essential tests only
import pytest
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from portfolio_system import PortfolioCalculator, DataFetcher

class TestCoreBusinessLogic:
    """Test only profit-critical functions"""
    
    def test_portfolio_return_calculation(self):
        # This is money - test thoroughly
        calc = PortfolioCalculator()

        )
        
        assert result == 60, f"Expected 60 shares, got {result}"
        assert calc.remaining_cash == 4000, "Cash tracking wrong"

        assert data.empty or data.isna().all().all(), "Should handle missing data gracefully"

# Mandatory assertions in production code
def calculate_portfolio_value(positions, prices):
    """Calculate total portfolio value with built-in validation"""

        system.sell('SPY', shares='all')
        
        # Validate cash reconciliation
        assert abs(system.cash - system.initial_cash) < 100, "Cash not properly tracked"
        assert len(system.positions) == 0, "Positions not properly closed"
    
    def test_strategy_performance_validation(self):
        """Test strategy meets minimum performance requirements"""
        strategy = MomentumStrategy()
        historical_data = fetch_test_data('2020-01-01', '2023-12-31')
        
        performance = strategy.backtest(historical_data)

- Annual Return: 12.3%
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.45
- Max Drawdown: 8.2%
- Live trading: 30 days profitable

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback_script.sh - Emergency rollback capability

set -e

echo "=== EMERGENCY ROLLBACK ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"

# Stop current system
systemctl stop portfolio-system

# Get latest backup
latest_backup=$(ls -t backups/ | head -1)
echo "Rolling back to: ${latest_backup}"

# Restore configuration and data
cp -r backups/${latest_backup}/config/* config/
cp -r backups/${latest_backup}/data/* data/

# Restore previous code version
git checkout HEAD~1  # Go back one commit

# Restart system
systemctl start portfolio-system
sleep 10

# Validate rollback
python health_check.py --quick
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Rollback successful"
    
    # Send alert about rollback
    python send_alert.py "System rolled back to ${latest_backup} due to deployment issues"
else
    echo "❌ Rollback failed - manual intervention required"
    exit 1

This testing and deployment framework ensures your system remains profitable while adding necessary software engineering rigor. The key principle is that all testing and deployment complexity must be justified by the business value at stake - don't over-engineer for a simple trading system.
