# UPDATED TO-DO LIST: Portfolio Maximizer v45 - ML Integration & Optimization

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS: 🔴 BLOCKED (Updated Nov 15, 2025 brutal run)
**Infrastructure in place**: ETL + Analysis + Visualization + Caching + k-fold CV + Multi-Source + Config-Driven + Checkpointing + LLM Integration  
**Recent Achievements**:

### 🚨 2025-11-15 Brutal Run Findings (blocking)
- `logs/pipeline_run.log:16932-17729` and `sqlite3 data/portfolio_maximizer.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"` confirmed the SQLite store is corrupted (`database disk image is malformed`, “rowid … out of order/missing from index”), so every persistence-dependent task in this list is blocked until the DB is rebuilt and `DatabaseManager._connect` handles this error like the existing disk-I/O branch.
- `logs/pipeline_run.log:2272-2279, 2624, 2979, 3263, 3547, …` demonstrate Stage 7 failing on every ticker with `ValueError: The truth value of a DatetimeIndex is ambiguous` because `scripts/run_etl_pipeline.py:1755-1764` evaluates `mssa_result.get('change_points') or []`. As soon as ~90 forecast rows are inserted the stage logs “Generated forecasts for 0 ticker(s)”, so all downstream Time Series/LLM tasks stall.
- The visualization hook subsequently throws `FigureBase.autofmt_xdate() got an unexpected keyword argument 'axis'` (lines 2626, 2981, …), meaning the dashboards mentioned in this file cannot be produced right now.
- Pandas/statsmodels warning spam remains (`forcester_ts/forecaster.py:128-136` Period round-trip; `_select_best_order` in `forcester_ts/sarimax.py:136-183` keeps unconverged grids) even though the Nov‑09 hardening note claimed otherwise.
- `scripts/backfill_signal_validation.py:281-292` still calls `datetime.utcnow()` with sqlite’s default converters, triggering the Python 3.12 deprecation warnings seen in `logs/backfill_signal_validation.log:15-22`.

**Blocking tasks that must precede every other TODO**
1. Recover/recreate `data/portfolio_maximizer.db` and update `DatabaseManager._connect` so `"database disk image is malformed"` leverages the reset/mirror logic.
2. Fix the MSSA `change_points` path (copy the `DatetimeIndex` to a list) and rerun `python scripts/run_etl_pipeline.py --stage time_series_forecasting` to rehydrate Stage 8.
3. Remove the unsupported `axis=` argument before invoking `FigureBase.autofmt_xdate()` so visualization checkpoints generate artefacts again.
4. Replace the deprecated Period coercion and tighten the SARIMAX grid to stop warning spam from drowning out actionable errors. *(Completed Nov 16; any residual warnings are now routed to `logs/warnings/warning_events.log` for auditing via `etl/warning_recorder.py`.)*
5. Update `scripts/backfill_signal_validation.py` to use timezone-aware timestamps and sqlite adapters prior to the nightly job described later in this document.
- ✅ **2025-11-16 status**: Items 1–4 shipped in `etl/database_manager.py`, `scripts/run_etl_pipeline.py`, `etl/visualizer.py`, `forcester_ts/forecaster.py`, and `forcester_ts/sarimax.py`. See `logs/pipeline_run.log:22237-22986` for the clean ETL execution. Item 5 (validator modernization) remains outstanding.
- Phase 4.8: Checkpointing & Event Logging (Oct 7, 2025)
- Phase 5.1: Alpha Vantage & Finnhub APIs Complete (Oct 7, 2025)
- Phase 5.2: LLM Integration Complete (Ollama) (Oct 8, 2025)
- Phase 5.3: Profit Calculation Fix Applied (Oct 14, 2025) ⚠️ CRITICAL
- Monitoring deployment script validated end-to-end (Oct 23, 2025)
- Autonomous trading entry point (`scripts/run_auto_trader.py`) now chains extraction → validation → forecasting → signal routing → execution with optional LLM fallback, keeping cash/positions/trade history synchronized each cycle.
- README + roadmap reposition the platform as an **Autonomous Profit Engine** and document the new loop in Key Features, Quick Start, and infrastructure bullet lists.
- Pipeline stage planner now forces Time Series forecasting/signal routing before any LLM work; LLM stages run strictly as fallback after the router.

**⚠️ STATUS ALERT**: Documentation is ahead of execution. Core Phase-A tasks (signal validation integration, enhanced portfolio math promotion, statistical tooling, paper trading) remain unshipped. Profitability metrics cannot yet be evaluated because the database holds incomplete signal records and no paper trades.

### 2025-11-12 Update
- ✅ `forcester_ts/` is the canonical forecasting stack; `TimeSeriesSignalGenerator` now handles GARCH volatility series safely and stamps HOLD provenance timestamps. Tests: `pytest tests/models/test_time_series_signal_generator.py -q` + targeted integration smoke.
- ✅ `scripts/monitor_llm_system.py` emits latency benchmarks + `llm_signal_backtests` summaries; JSON reports live under `logs/`.
- ✅ `schedule_backfill.bat` ships for nightly validator replays (Task Scheduler registration still required).
- ⚠️ deepseek-coder:6.7b latency remains 15–38 s (goal <5 s); explore prompt slimming, alternate models, or streaming fallback before enabling paper trading.
- ⚠️ SQLite occasionally returns `disk I/O error` when adding new `llm_signals` columns—rerun migration after closing DB handles; track in `SYSTEM_STATUS_2025-10-22.md`.
- 🚧 Paper trading & broker wiring deferred until latency + nightly jobs stay green for 48 h.
- ⚠️ ETL blockers found in `logs/errors/errors.log` (Nov 2–7):  
  - `DataStorage.train_validation_test_split()` raises `TypeError` when CV passes `test_size`.
  - `ZeroDivisionError` when CV returns zero folds (insufficient history).
  - `sqlite3.OperationalError: disk I/O error` during OHLCV persistence—database file or disk needs attention.
  - Missing parquet engine (`pyarrow`/`fastparquet`) prevents checkpoint serialization on Windows, halting extraction.
  - LLM migrations skipped because of the same disk issue; latency monitor still reports 15–39 s inference + sub-5 tokens/sec throughput.
  Immediate remediation is required before rerunning ETL or the autonomous loop against live data.
- 🧪 `bash/comprehensive_brutal_test.sh` (Nov 12) highlights current test status:
  - Profit-critical functions + profit-factor + report generation: ✅ PASS.
  - ETL suites (`test_data_storage`, `test_preprocessor`, `test_time_series_cv`, `test_data_source_manager`, `test_checkpoint_manager`): ✅ PASS (92 tests) but `tests/etl/test_data_validator.py` missing.
  - Time Series forecasting/LLM suites: ❌ NOT EXECUTED — script timed out with `Broken pipe` after ETL phase. Need to fix missing tests + timeout before promoting TS-first architecture.
- ✅ Live TS signals verified via `logs/ts_signal_demo.json`; the generator now normalises pandas payloads, captures decision context, and surfaces BUY/SELL output outside the test harness.
- ✅ `etl/checkpoint_manager.py` replaces metadata atomically (Path.replace) so Windows runs no longer fail with `[WinError 183]` when saving repeated checkpoints.
- ⚠️ `scripts/backfill_signal_validation.py` now bootstraps `sys.path` for CLI invocations; production still needs a scheduled task pointing at `schedule_backfill.bat`.

### Implementation Gaps (Nov 6, 2025 snapshot)
- ✅ LLM signal persistence now records `signal_type`, timestamps, and backtest metrics (`llm_signal_backtests` feeds dashboards).
- ✅ 5-layer validator + statistical diagnostics execute inside the pipeline with regression coverage.
- ✅ SAMOSSA + SARIMAX hybrid forecasts persist explained-variance diagnostics; RL/CUSUM promotion remains gated on profitability milestones.
- ✅ `TimeSeriesForecaster.evaluate()` now computes RMSE / sMAPE / tracking-error for every model + ensemble; metrics are written to SQLite so dashboards and the ensemble grid-search can rely on realised performance instead of static heuristics.
- ✅ Ensemble confidence scoring blends those metrics with AIC/EVR and variance-ratio tests, and MSSA-RL gains a CuPy-accelerated path (optional) plus change-point weighting so regime breaks are handled automatically.
- ✅ Time Series ensemble is the **default signal generator** (per `Documentation/REFACTORING_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` / `Documentation/REFACTORING_STATUS.md`): `models/time_series_signal_generator.py` + `signal_router.py` route TS output first, with LLM retained solely for fallback/redundancy.
- ⚠️ Paper trading engine, broker integration, stress testing, and regime detection remain outstanding.
- 🟡 Nightly validation wrapper `schedule_backfill.bat` is ready—needs Task Scheduler registration in production environments.

### Next Steps — Critical Gap Closure
1. ✅ Confirmed `etl/portfolio_math.py` (enhanced engine) is the promoted dependency. Verification logged via automated tests and `scripts/run_etl_pipeline.py` portfolio metrics output.
2. ✅ Repair the signal and risk persistence contract (Nov 5, 2025): `ai_llm/llm_database_integration.py` migrates `llm_risk_assessments` to accept `'extreme'` and new tests validate the schema (`python -m pytest tests/ai_llm/test_llm_enhancements.py::TestLLMDatabaseIntegration::test_risk_assessment_extreme_persisted`).
3. ✅ Persist validator telemetry via LLMSignalTracker (Nov 5, 2025): `scripts/run_etl_pipeline.py` now registers each signal/decision with `LLMSignalTracker`, and `python -m pytest tests/scripts/test_track_llm_signals.py` locks the wiring in CI.
4. ✅ Statistical scoring restored: `SignalValidator.backtest_signal_quality` now feeds bootstrap/Ljung–Box results into `llm_signal_backtests` and updates per-signal metrics.
5. ✅ Latency guard upgraded: `ai_llm/ollama_client.py` now auto-switches models when token throughput drops below the configured `token_rate_failover_threshold`; keep logging sub-5 s benchmarks via `logs/latency_benchmark.json` to confirm the guard holds.
6. ✅ Time-series stage now performs a rolling hold-out per ticker, calls `forecaster.evaluate(...)`, and stores RMSE/sMAPE/tracking-error in `time_series_forecasts.regression_metrics`; keep piping those fields into dashboards and reports.
7. ✅ Enforce the “Time Series first, LLM fallback” routing path (`config/signal_routing_config.yml`, `models/signal_router.py`) across every environment so the refactored architecture stays consistent with documentation.
8. 🟡 Register `schedule_backfill.bat` with Windows Task Scheduler (e.g. `schtasks /Create /TN PortfolioMaximizer_BackfillSignals /TR "\"C:\path\to\schedule_backfill.bat\"" /SC DAILY /ST 02:00 /F`) so nightly validation/backtests stay current.
9. 🚧 Promote paper trading engine + broker integration once monitoring and nightly jobs are confirmed stable (Phase A next major workstream).
10. ⚠️ Remediate ETL blockers logged Nov 2–7 (`DataStorage.train_validation_test_split()` TypeError, zero-fold CV `ZeroDivisionError`, SQLite `disk I/O error`, missing `pyarrow`/`fastparquet`) before attempting further live yfinance/Alpha Vantage/Finnhub runs.
11. 🆕 Validate `scripts/run_auto_trader.py` and hook it into the paper-vs-live adapters (XTB/cTrader) once profit KPIs clear the guardrails; execute the pending Time Series + signal-router tests (and re-run `bash/comprehensive_brutal_test.sh`) to certify the autonomous workflow without timeouts.

**Execution Guardrail**  
- Treat this as an autonomous blocker run using `Documentation/AGENT_DEV_CHECKLIST.md`, `Documentation/AGENT_INSTRUCTION.md`, and `Documentation/arch_tree.md` for navigation.  
- **Do not** proceed to downstream implementation (paper trading, broker integration, dashboards, Phase B ML) until the remaining yellow items are marked “Verified Complete” inside `Documentation/implementation_checkpoint.md`.

**📚 NEW**: 
- A comprehensive sequenced implementation plan has been created. See **`Documentation/SEQUENCED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** and **`Documentation/NEXT_TO_DO_SEQUENCED.md`** for the complete 12-week implementation plan with critical fixes prioritized first, then LLM operationalization (Phase A) and ML enhancement (Phase B).
- **Stub Implementation Review**: Complete review of all missing/incomplete implementations documented in **`Documentation/STUB_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**. The cTrader client + order manager items are now delivered; remaining blockers include the performance dashboard, disaster recovery, production deployment scripts, and demo-to-live validation.
- **🟡 Time Series Signal Generation Refactoring IMPLEMENTED** (Nov 6, 2025) - **ROBUST TESTING REQUIRED**: See **`Documentation/REFACTORING_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`** for details. Time Series ensemble is now the DEFAULT signal generator with LLM as fallback. Includes 50 tests written (38 unit + 12 integration) - **NEEDS EXECUTION & VALIDATION**, unified database schema - **TESTING REQUIRED**, and complete pipeline integration - **TESTING REQUIRED**.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UPDATE: ML-FIRST QUANTITATIVE APPROACH

### *Fundamental Correction Required*
The previous "ML optional" designation represents a **fundamental architectural flaw** that contradicts quantitative trading principles. ML must be the **core engine**, not decoration.

**CORRECTED DATA FLOW:**
```
DATA LAYER → ETL → FEATURE ENGINEERING → ML FORECASTING → QUANTITATIVE SIGNALS → PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION
                        ↑                                      ↓
                  Feature Importance                   Probabilistic Position Sizing
                        ↓                                      ↓
                  Model Interpretation                 Risk-Adjusted Allocation

    'emergency_stop_accuracy': 0.45  # Stop if accuracy drops below 45%
}
```

## ðŸš€ PHASE 7: TIME-SERIES MODEL UPGRADE ROADMAP

### **Time-Series Model Upgrade Overview**
- Run SAMOSSA, SARIMAX, and GARCH forecasts in parallel with existing LLM signals.
- Maintain backward compatibility by routing through `signal_router.py` with feature flags and unchanged downstream interfaces.
- Evaluate models with rolling cross-validation, walk-forward tests, and loss-focused metrics (profit factor, drawdown).
- Promote the most consistent performer to default only after statistically significant, loss-reducing outperformance; keep LLM as fallback.
- Expand monitoring so regressions trigger automatic reversion to the current LLM-only configuration.

```

> **SAMOSSA Implementation Status (Nov 05, 2025)**  
> • SSA decomposition + residual ARIMA forecasting is live inside `etl/time_series_forecaster.py`, emitting explained-variance diagnostics and confidence bands.  
> • CUSUM change-point scoring, Q-learning intervention policies, and GPU/CuPy optimisation remain on the backlog until paper-trading metrics satisfy `QUANTIFIABLE_SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` gates.  
> • Monitoring tasks must ingest SAMOSSA diagnostics before toggling feature flags for downstream consumers.
