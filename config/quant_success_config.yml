    # healthy regimes clear the bar while obviously weak ones
    # continue to be demoted to HOLD.
    min_annual_return: 0.05      # Was 0.10 – still requires positive annual edge
    min_sharpe: 0.40             # Was 0.50 – modest risk-adjusted return
    min_sortino: 0.60            # Was 0.70 – focuses on downside volatility
    max_drawdown: 0.25           # Was 0.20 – allows slightly deeper pullbacks
    min_profit_factor: 1.10      # Was 1.20 – profit factor > 1.1 still a real edge
    min_win_rate: 0.50           # Win rate must stay above 50%
    min_expected_profit: 15.0    # Was 25.0 – still meaningful vs 25k book
    require_significance: false  # Loosen for TS exploration; can be re-enabled later
    min_information_ratio: 0.0   # Raises floor when significance required

  # Optional per-ticker overrides for success criteria; used by
  # models/time_series_signal_generator.TimeSeriesSignalGenerator when
  # building quant validation profiles. This allows asset-class-aware
  # expected_profit thresholds without changing the global floor.
