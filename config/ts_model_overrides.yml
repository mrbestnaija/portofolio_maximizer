# TS Model Overrides – Per-Ticker / Per-Regime
#
# Purpose
# -------
# This file provides an optional, explicit override layer for time-series
# model choices on a (ticker, regime) basis. It is intended to be driven by
# evidence from:
#   - ts_model_candidates (populated via scripts/run_ts_model_search.py),
#   - logs/automation/ts_model_config_proposals.json
#     (emitted by scripts/generate_ts_model_config_proposals.py).
#
# Governance
# ----------
# - This file is *not* mutated automatically; updates are made by humans
#   after reviewing proposals and dashboards.
# - Model selection remains config-driven and auditable:
#     1. run_ts_model_search.py → ts_model_candidates
#     2. summarize_ts_candidates.py → ts_model_candidates_summary.json
#     3. generate_ts_model_config_proposals.py → ts_model_config_proposals.json
#     4. Human approves subset → edits ts_model_overrides.yml
# - Forecaster code or routing helpers should treat overrides as an optional
#   layer on top of config/model_profiles.yml.
#
# Schema
# ------
# overrides:
#   - ticker: "AAPL"                # required, string
#     regime: "high_vol"            # required, string (e.g. default, high_vol)
#     candidate_name: "sarimax_only"  # required, matches ts_model_candidates.candidate_name
#     profile_hint: "default"       # optional, name from config/model_profiles.yml
#     notes: "Selected after DM test vs baseline, stability >= 0.6"
#
# Example usage in code (conceptual):
#   1. Detect regime for ticker returns.
#   2. Look for matching (ticker, regime) in ts_model_overrides.yml.
#   3. If present, select the indicated candidate/profile; otherwise fall
#      back to sleeve/regime model_profiles routing.

overrides:
  # --- EXAMPLE ONLY: safe/core sleeve in normal regime ---
  # - ticker: "AAPL"
  #   regime: "default"
  #   candidate_name: "sarimax_samossa"
  #   profile_hint: "default"
  #   notes: "Best candidate by score with stable RMSE and DM p<=0.05 vs baseline."

  # --- EXAMPLE ONLY: speculative/crypto sleeve in high volatility ---
  # - ticker: "BTC-USD"
  #   regime: "high_vol"
  #   candidate_name: "samossa_only"
  #   profile_hint: "high_vol_risk"
  #   notes: "Chosen for better downside tracking in high_vol regime."
