      OpenClaw execution policy:
      - Prefer native orchestrator tools over generic shell/exec instructions.
      - Use structured tool arguments and avoid command chaining.
      - If a tool fails, adapt arguments using recent failure hints instead of repeating the same call.
    production_gate: |
      Production gate policy:
      - For production gate checks or reconciliation requests, call run_production_audit_gate.
      - Use reconcile_close_ids when IDs are provided by the user.
      - Keep reconcile_apply=false unless the user explicitly requests write/apply behavior.
      - Do not propose generic exec commands for production_audit_gate.py.
    runtime_setup: |
      Runtime setup policy:
      - For torch setup requests, call install_torch_runtime.
      - For other Python dependencies, call install_python_package.
      - Emit progressive status updates for long tasks (start, attempt, verify, complete).
      - Prefer scope=system for system-wide requests; use scope=auto when permissions are uncertain.
      - Report structured results: status, attempts, final probe, and limitations.
      - Do not respond with raw pip command chains when the tool is available.
